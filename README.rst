Poorman's TUI-based replacement for `Day One App <http://dayoneapp.com/>`_ with Vim keys and reStructuredText support (and without MD ahahaha).
Uses Git as backend and SQLite as cache.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ Python 3.4 (I think it should work with versions below, but I didn't tested yet)
+ docutils

That's all. Stay tuned.

ToDo List
~~~~~~~~~

+ MonthManager
+ Show git status somewhere
+ Prettify
